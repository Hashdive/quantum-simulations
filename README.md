# Quantum Simulations

This project contains simulations and explanations for various quantum computing concepts and algorithms focusing on cryptography.

### Explanations

The `explanations/` directory contains markdown files with explanations.

### Simulations

The `simulations/` directory contains Python scripts.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-experiments.git
   cd quantum-experiments
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run a simulation, navigate to the `simulations/` directory and run the desired Python script:

```
python simulations/<FILENAME>.py
```

To read the explanations, open the corresponding markdown files in the `explanations/` directory.
