# Shor's Algorithm: A Detailed, Simplified Explanation

## What is Shor's Algorithm?

Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm that can find the factors of a number much faster than any known classical algorithm. In this explanation, we're using it to factor the number 15 (which we know is 3 × 5).

## The Big Picture

1. We pick a random number 'a'.
2. We use a quantum computer to find the "order" of this number.
3. We use this "order" to find the factors of our original number.

Now, let's break this down further.

## Step 1: Picking a Random Number

```python
a = randint(2, N)  # Random 'a' between 2 and N-1
```

We choose a random number 'a' between 2 and N-1 (where N is the number we're factoring, 15 in this case).

## Step 2: Checking if Our Choice is Good

```python
if gcd(a, N) != 1:
    print(f"'a' and {N} are not coprime, trivial factor found: {gcd(a, N)}")
    continue  # Retry with a different 'a'
```

We check if our chosen 'a' and N have any common factors. If they do, we've accidentally found a factor and we start over.

## Step 3: The Quantum Part - Finding the "Order"

This is where quantum computing comes in. We're trying to find something called the "order" of 'a' modulo N. The "order" is the smallest positive integer r such that a^r ≡ 1 (mod N).

### 3.1: Setting Up the Quantum Circuit

```python
def qpe_amod15(a):
    N_COUNT = 8
    qc = QuantumCircuit(4 + N_COUNT, N_COUNT)
    for q in range(N_COUNT):
        qc.h(q)  # Initialize counting qubits in state |+>
    qc.x(N_COUNT)  # Auxiliary register in state |1>
```

We create a quantum circuit with:
- 8 qubits for counting (N_COUNT)
- 4 qubits for our number (15 needs 4 bits to represent it)
- We put the counting qubits in superposition with Hadamard gates (h)
- We set the auxiliary register to |1> with an X gate

### 3.2: Applying Controlled Operations

```python
for q in range(N_COUNT):  # Do controlled-U operations
    qc.append(c_amod15(a, 2**q), [q] + [i + N_COUNT for i in range(4)])
```

We apply controlled operations that essentially perform "a^(2^q) mod 15" operations.

### 3.3: Quantum Fourier Transform

```python
qc.append(qft_dagger(N_COUNT), range(N_COUNT))  # Inverse QFT
```

We apply the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform to extract the period information.

### 3.4: Measurement

```python
qc.measure(range(N_COUNT), range(N_COUNT))
```

We measure the counting qubits.

### 3.5: Running the Quantum Circuit

```python
aer_sim = Aer.get_backend('aer_simulator')
job = aer_sim.run(transpile(qc, aer_sim), shots=1, memory=True)
readings = job.result().get_memory()
```

We run our quantum circuit on a simulator and get the results.

### 3.6: Interpreting the Results

```python
phase = int(readings[0], 2) / (2**N_COUNT)
```

We convert our measurement to a phase between 0 and 1.

## Step 4: Classical Post-Processing

```python
frac = Fraction(phase).limit_denominator(N)
r = frac.denominator
```

We use the continued fractions algorithm to try to find the "order" r from our phase.

## Step 5: Using the Order to Find Factors

```python
if r % 2 != 0:
    print(f"Odd order {r}, retrying...")
    continue  # Retry if the order is odd

guesses = [gcd(a**(r//2) - 1, N), gcd(a**(r//2) + 1, N)]
```

If r is even, we use it to make guesses about the factors of N.

## Step 6: Checking Our Guesses

```python
for guess in guesses:
    if guess not in [1, N] and N % guess == 0:
        print(f"*** Non-trivial factor found: {guess} ***")
        FACTOR_FOUND = True
        break
```

We check if our guesses are actual factors of N.

## Why This Works

The magic of Shor's algorithm comes from the quantum computer's ability to find the "order" quickly. Classically, finding this order is very hard and takes a long time for large numbers.

Once we have the order, some number theory tells us that there's a good chance that gcd(a^(r/2) ± 1, N) will give us a factor of N.

## The Power of Quantum

In our small example factoring 15, the power of quantum computing isn't obvious. But for very large numbers, quantum computers could factor them exponentially faster than classical computers. This is why Shor's algorithm is so important - it could potentially break RSA encryption, which relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers.

## Limitations of This Implementation

1. It only works for factoring 15.
2. It uses a simulator, not a real quantum computer.
3. Real quantum computers have noise and errors that this simulation doesn't account for.

Despite these limitations, this implementation demonstrates the core ideas behind Shor's algorithm and provides insight into how quantum algorithms can solve certain problems much faster than classical algorithms.
